#	Notes from Learn C the Hard Way

-  If an array is two-dimensional, you need a pointer to a pointer

-  If a character string is going to cross multiple lines, add a \
	at the end of the line and begin the rest of the string at
	the beginning of the next line (otherwise, the extra spaces
	will be added into the string).

-  "The purpose of a pointer is to let you manually index into blocks
	of memory when an array won't do it right...A pointer gives
	you raw, direct access to a block of memory so you can work
	with it."

- use malloc for "memory allocate" 
	pass to malloc the sizeof()

- strdup()
	string duplicate - like malloc, it also copies the original string
	into the memory it creates

- formatted I/O uses the % parameter
	unformatted I/O is a byte stream (1 byte is read at a time)

- open family of system calls are the unbuffered, direct calls to the kernel

- fopen family are library functions in C

- man ( -S 2 read ) 2 has information on system calls

- man ( -S 3 fread ) 3 has information on library routines

- some library functions have embedded system calls. (ex. scanf & printf
	use read and write)	

- use %p with printf to print pointers (or addresses)
	to be used with void * (sizes of pointers to different types differ)

- "If you didn't get it from malloc or a function that got it from malloc, 
	then it's on the stack."
